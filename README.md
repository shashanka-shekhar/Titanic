# Titanic

Competition Description(Kaggle) :

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Contains a lot of features about passengers like - Name, Age, Pclass and the target variable - Survived.

Languages and libraries :

This project uses python3, sklearn, numpy, pandas in jupyter notebook(Anaconda Distribution).

Models and techniques used :

 1. KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier and SVC.
 2. RandomizedSearchCV to search for parameters for RandoForestClassifier.
